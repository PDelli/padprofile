<font size=4 face=Georgia color=#E97451><center>A youthful face with curious yellow eyes like amber jewels, all framed by long, flowing streaks of azure hair. He wears all a black robe and holds a peculiar staff on his back. He seems to be unstable and burst sometimes without any reason. He is known by his wide smile and his strange laugh that he force to try to intimidate others.
